    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPress" target="_blank">SteamPress</a>, is an open
        source blog engine written in Swift and built on top of the
        <a href="https://vapor.codes/" target="_blank">Vapor</a> framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is designed to be simple to include into any website that is built using Vapor using
        just the Vapor Provider. It can be added to a path in a site or can even be used as the main
        site itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is an example site
        <a href="https://github.com/brokenhandsio/SteamPressExample" target="_blank">on Github</a> that
        demonstrates how to integrate SteamPress into a site, including all the Leaf templates and how
        to use them. It is a good starting place to clone and get up and running quickly. This site
        is actually the example site deployed!
    </p>

    <p>
        The example site also includes shows how to integrate
        <a href="https://github.com/brokenhandsio/VaporSecurityHeaders" target="_blank">Vapor Security
        Headers</a> and how to have custom error pages in Vapor.
